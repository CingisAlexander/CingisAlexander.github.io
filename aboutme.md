I grew up in Southern California, and moved to the Bay Area to study Biology and Conflict Resolution at UC Berkeley. I spent the next three years teaching environmental science to middle and high school students in Yosemite, the Marin Headlands, and Thailand for the nonprofit organization NatureBridge, and National Geographic Student Expeditions. Those were some of the best years of my life. I learned how to comfortably speak to large groups of people, communicate science to diverse audiences, and think on my feet. I also learned that
I'm insatiably curious and driven to learn new things and make a difference in the world.  

I currently live in Davis, California, where I'm a PhD Candidate studying physical hydrology at the University of California Davis with my supervisor, Dr. Graham Fogg. I develop 3D numerical hydrodynamic flow and contaminant transport models to study regional-scale contaminant transport in aquifers. I create statistical and machine learning models to evaluate domestic well vulnerability to drought. And when I have free time, I enjoy building dashboard and expanding my knowledge of the enormous and expanding ecosystem of data tools available today. Outside of work, I love to try new recipes, travel, explore the alpine environment with a rope and harness, and get in the cold California ocean to catch waves.
