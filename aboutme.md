My name is Cingis (read "Chingis") and I study at the Technical University of Munich the master program: mathematics in data science. And additionally, to my studies, I was able to obtain industry experiences in data science at companies such as  Allianz or Capgemini.

To my special interests in data science belongs robust and explainable machine learning (ML). I believe, that these two disciplines are key factors in the successfull deployment of ML in diverse industries. In short, by robust ML, I mainly mean robust training procedures and models. The main characteristic of robust training procedures and models is the ability to be less vulnerable to outliers or some noises in the given data. And by explainable machine learning, I mean the ability to understand and to explain a decision made by a trained model given an input. Of course, the above description of robust and explainable ML is not perfect. But I think it gives the right intuition.

On this blog, you can find my projects and blog posts. To navigate through the project click on button "PROJECTS" in the right upper corner; the the same applies for my blog posts.The content is mainly devoted to data science; however, if there will something in my opinion worth sharing, then you will find a post about it as well.

If you have any questions or remarks, feel free to get in touch with me. You can find me on LinkedIn or reach by email. The email and LinkedIn icons are both displayed below.
