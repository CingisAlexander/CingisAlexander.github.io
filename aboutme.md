My name is Cingis (read "Chingis"), and I studied at the Technical University of Munich the master program: Mathematics in Data Science. In addition to my studies, I obtained industry experiences in data science at companies such as  Allianz or Capgemini. I currently work as a Data Scientist in Consulting at [Steadforce](https://de.steadforce.com).

My interest in data science belongs to natural language understanding, robust machine learning (ML), and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). I believe that these two disciplines belong to the key factors in the successful deployment of ML in diverse industries. 

In short, by robust ML, I mainly mean robust training procedures and models. The main characteristic of robust training procedures and models is the ability to be less vulnerable to outliers or some noises in the given data. And by XAI, I mean the ability to understand and to explain a decision made by a trained model given an input. Of course, the above description of robust and explainable ML is not perfect. But I think it gives the right intuition.

Check this [post blog on XAI](./_posts/2020-06-26-XAI.md) if you want to know more about XAI. There is also a project devoted to robust ML; you can find it [here](adjusting_keras_loop.md).

You can find my personal projects and blog posts on this blog. To navigate through the projects, click on the button "PROJECTS" in the right upper corner; the same applies to my blog posts. The content will be mainly devoted to data science.
