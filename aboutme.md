I grew up in Southern California, and moved to the Bay Area to study Biology and Conflict Resolution at UC Berkeley. I spent the next three years teaching environmental science to middle and high school students in Yosemite and the Marin Headlandsfor the educational nonprofit NatureBridge. I spent summers in Thailand leading trips for National Geographic Student Expeditions, and Adventures Cross Country. Those were some of the best years of my life. I learned how to speak comfortably to large groups of people, communicate science to diverse audiences, and think on my feet. I learned that I'm insatiably curious and driven to learn new things and make a difference in the world.  

I currently live in Davis, California, where I'm a PhD Candidate studying physical hydrology at the University of California Davis with my supervisor, Dr. Graham Fogg. I develop 3D numerical hydrodynamic flow and contaminant transport models to study regional-scale contaminant transport in heterogeneous aquifers. I create statistical and machine learning models to evaluate domestic well vulnerability to drought. And when I have free time, I enjoy building dashboards and expanding my knowledge of the enormous and expanding ecosystem of data tools available today. Outside of work, I love to try new recipes, travel, explore the alpine environment with a rope and harness, and get in the cold California ocean to catch waves.
