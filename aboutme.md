I grew up in Southern California, and moved to the Bay Area to study Biology and Conflict Resolution at UC Berkeley. I spent the next three years teaching environmental science to middle and high school students in Yosemite, the Marin Headlands, and Thailand for the nonprofit organization NatureBridge, and National Geographic Student Expeditions.  

I currently live in Davis, California, where I'm a PhD Candidate studying physical hydrology at the University of California Davis with my supervisor, Dr. Graham Fogg. I develop numerical hydrodynamic flow and contaminant transport models, statewide hydroeconomic optimization models, statistical and machine learning models, and mathematical models of environmental systems. My research addresses how climate change and water management affects water quantity and quality in the state of California. I love to learn new things, (especially in the R programming language), travel and explore the outdoors, climb mountains, and cook.
