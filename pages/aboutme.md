I grew up in Southern California, and moved to the Bay Area to study Biology and Conflict Resolution at UC Berkeley. I spent the next three years teaching environmental science to middle and high school students in Yosemite, the Marin Headlands, and Thailand for the nonprofit organization NatureBridge, and National Geographic Student Expeditions. Those were some of the best years of my life. I learned how to talk in front of large groups of people and make science accessible and entertaining. I also came to realize that I'm an insatiably curious person that thrives on learning new things and making a difference in the world.  

I currently live in Davis, California, where I'm a PhD Candidate studying physical hydrology at the University of California Davis with my supervisor, Dr. Graham Fogg. I develop 3D numerical hydrodynamic flow and contaminant transport models to study regional-scale contaminant transport in aquifers, statistical and machine learning models to evaluate domestic well vulnerability to drought, and other mathematical models of environmental systems. My research addresses how climate change and water management affects water quantity and quality in my home state of California. I'm currently excited about expanding my machine learning and natural language processing toolkit, and developing data pipelines to automate the collection, processing, reporting, and visualization of data from remote sensing networks. In my free time, I enjoy trying new recipes, traveling, exploring the alpine environment with a rope and harness, and getting in the cold California ocean to catch waves.
