I was recently pretty impressed with [Jupyter's](http://jupyter.org/) newest creation, the Jupyter Lab IDE. You can test drive an online demostration of Jupyter Lab with a Python and R kernel [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo/18a9793b58ba86660b5ab964e1aeaf7324d667c8?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fdemo%2FLorenz.ipynb).  

I downloaded a version, and found that the R Kernel was missing! To get the R kernel up and running in Jupyter Lab was a bit more complicated than expected. This guide is meant to break things down step by step. There are certaintly other ways to do this, but this is a tried a true method. Sorry mac Users, I did this at work on my PC.   


***  


# 1. Install Anaconda 

Download [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). This gives you a few important things: Jupyter notebooks, and the Anaconda Prompt.  

***  

# 2. Install the Jupyter client 

Search for the Anaconda Prompt in your computer, **right click, and run As Adminstrator**.  

In the prompt type `conda install -c anaconda jupyter_client`.

# 3. Install the IR Kernel 

I assume you have R on your computer. If not, I recommend downloading it [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/).  

Find the location of `R.exe` on your computer. In my computer this executable is at: `C:\Program Files\R\R-3.4.3\bin`.

***  

Open another Anaconda Prompt as Adminstrator and change directories to wherever `R.exe` is on your computer with `cd file path`. On my computer it's: `cd C:\Program Files\R\R-3.4.3\bin`, but it might be different for you.  

Then run R from within Anaconda Prompt in Admin mode with `R.exe`.  

You'll notice that you're in an R session. From here, run the following three commands into the terminal.  

1. `install.packages("devtools")`  

2. `devtools::install_github("IRkernel/IRkernel")`  

3. `IRkernel::installspec()`  

In order, they (1) install the devtools package which gets you the `install_github()` function, (2) install the IR Kernel from github, and (3) tell Jupyter where to find the IR Kernel.  

***  

# 4. Open Jupyter Lab and enjoy your new R kernel!  

Open Anaconda Prompt and type in `jupyter lab`. Jupyter Lab should launch and display both a python and R kernel.

Lastly, I found the [Jupyter Lab User's Guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to be pretty helpful, and you might too.
