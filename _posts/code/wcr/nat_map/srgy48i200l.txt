  Description:
    Abstract:
      The grayscale conterminous United States shaded relief data were derived 
      from National Elevation Dataset (NED) data, and show the terrain of the 
      conterminous United States at a resolution of 200 meters.  The NED is a
      raster product assembled by the U.S. Geological Survey, designed to 
      provide national elevation data in a seamless form with a consistent 
      datum, elevation unit, and projection.  Data corrections made in the 
      NED assembly process minimize artifacts, permit edge matching, and fill 
      sliver areas of missing data.  
    Purpose:
      The grayscale shaded relief images were developed to portray the terrain 
      of the United States.  They are intended for visual purposes only.  The 
      original NED data must be used for conducting analysis and determining 
      elevation values.
    Supplemental_Information:
      The associated world file is included as part of the GeoTIFF.  The 
      contents of the world file are:
      >200.0000
      >0.000000
      >0.000000
      >-200.0000
      >-2262900.0000
      >1038900.0000

      For the convenience of Arc/INFO users, the GeoTIFF image also has a text 
      file of the image description that includes map projection and datum 
      information in a readable format, so data may be easily ingested back into 
      Arc/INFO Grid. This ancillary file is available on request.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Four elevation mosaics were extracted from the National Elevation 
        Dataset (NED) and used to produce the shaded relief images of the 
        conterminous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico and the U.S. 
        Virgin Islands.  A separate image was created for each of the four 
        areas because, at 200-meter resolution, file size for an elevation 
        mosaic of all of the United States would exceed the processing capacity 
        of some commonly-used GIS and image processing software packages.

        For the conterminous United States, elevation data were extracted from 
        the NED and projected to a Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area (LAZ) projection 
        centered on 100 degrees West, 45 degrees North, with a pixel size of 200 
        meters.  The datum for NED data is NAD83, except for Alaska which uses 
        NAD27.  Because there is no ellipsoidal form of the Lambert Azimuthal 
        Equal-Area projection, once data have been projected to LAZ they lose 
        any datum affiliation and instead are based on a sphere with a radius of 
        6370997 meters.  However, some commonly-used software packages will 
        report an error if a datum is not specified, so to accommodate such 
        software, the GeoTIFF for this shaded-relief map layer retains the NAD83 
        datum associated with the original NED data from which it was derived.

        Using the Arc/INFO Polygrid command, a 0/1 land/water mask was created 
        for the conterminous United States at the same 200 meter resolution as 
        the elevation data, using coastline data clipped from the National Atlas 
        shoreline file.  The land/water mask was applied to the 16-bit elevation 
        grid.  The masked elevation grid as well as the mask itself is available 
        on request.  More information on the NED may be found by following the 
        links at <http://ned.usgs.gov>. 

        Shaded relief was created from the masked land/water elevation data set 
        using the Arc/INFO Hillshade command with these 
        parameters:
        >Azimuth 315 degrees
        >Sun angle 45 degrees
        >Vertical exaggeration factor 10

        A second mask that separated U.S. land from non-U.S. land was created 
        with Arc/INFO Polygrid, then applied to the shaded relief image in 
        Adobe Photoshop.  

        To set colors for oceans and non-U.S. lands, the grayscale shaded relief 
        image was first converted to index color in Photoshop.  Pixel value 255 
        was already reserved for water pixels, and so index 255 was set to rgb 
        value (132, 193, 255), the blue color for oceans used in the National 
        Atlas online Map Maker.  There was no pixel value reserved for non-U.S. 
        land, so pixel value 254 was arbitrarily chosen for this class.  
        Existing pixels with a value of 254 were remapped to 253 in Photoshop, 
        causing a negligible loss of contrast.  Non-U.S. lands were set to 
        pixel value 254 by selecting them with the previously created mask, then 
        index 254 was set to rgb value (132, 158, 172), the gray color used for 
        non-U.S. land in the National Atlas online Map Maker. 

        Masked images from Photoshop were saved as TIFF's, then ingested into 
        Arc/INFO's Grid module, saved as TIFF's from Arc/INFO, and then 
        processed through a USGS GeoTIFF software program to create fully-
        compliant GeoTIFFs with valid header information.
