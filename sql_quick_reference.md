### Intro  <a name="intro"></a>
In this project, I plan to add examples of SQL queries that cover different topics, for instance, recursive queries, window function.

This is a living project, i.e. I will from time to time add new useful examples

#### To give credits
The most of examples and SQL queries are based or taken from blog-posts or my university courses. I will at each section add also the corresponding reference so that in case of more interest you can read in more depth the corresponding reference.

### Table manipulation <a name="paragraph1"></a>
Here we will look at how to delete, update data from a table, and how to declare a table and insert data into the table.
All examples for deleting data, updating data, and table declaration and insertion were overtaken and adjusted from **Gabriel CÃ¡nepa**'s post in [pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/manipulating-data-using-insert-update-delete-sql-server).

#### Deleting Data <a name="subparagraph1"></a>
_Syntax_:
```sql
Delete From table_name
Where field = z;
```
*Example*:
```sql
Delete From customer
Where customer_id = 10;
```

#### Updating Data <a name="subparagraph2"></a>
_Syntax_:
```sql
Update table_name
Set field1 = x, field2 = y
Where field1 = z;
```

*Example*:
```sql
Update customers
Set customer_name = "Thomas and Frank Gluecklich", customer_address = "Strasse Neben an 34"
Where customer_name = "Thomas Gluecklich"
```


#### Table Declaration & Inserting Data <a name="subparagraph3"></a>
*Table declaration:*
```sql
Create Table customers (
	customer_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
	customer_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	customer_address VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (customer_id)
);
```

*Data insertion:*
```sql
Insert Into table_name (field2, field1, ...)
Values (value2, value1, ...), (value3, value3, ...);
```
*Example*
```sql
INSERT INTO customers (customer_name, customer_address)
Values 
	("Hans Klobasa", "Stredni ulice"),
	("Thomas Schmidt", "Velka ulice");
```

### Recursive Queries <a name="paragraph2"></a>
Suppose we have a table that was declared using the following query
```sql
Create Table edges (
	vertex_from INT,
	vertex_to INT);
```
This table models the edges of the below graph:
<p align="center">
<img src="/img/sql_queries_recursive.jpg" alt="geo" width="300" height="150"/>
</p>
So, the table contains for instance the entry: `(1,2)` because there is an edge coming from the vertex $1$ and going to the vertex $2$.

Now, the goal is to figure out what everything we can reach by starting at the vertex $1$. To solve this problem we use recursive queries.

Firstly, we declare a `view` that will contain all possible paths. Then, we check out all paths starting at vertex $1$.
```sql
Create View paths(S, T) (
	(select vertex_from as S, vertex_to as T
	from edges) 
	Union all
	(select edges.vertex_from, paths.T
	from edges, paths
	where edges.vertex_to = paths.S));
```
Find all paths starting at $1$.
```sql
select S,T
from paths
where S = 1
```

This example is based on a lecture for the course Einsatz und Realisierung von Datenbanksystemen held by Professor Kemper at the Technical University Munich.

### Grouping Sets, Rollup and Cube Aggregations <a name="paragraph3"></a>
Suppose a table that was created using the following declaration

```sql
Create Table smartphone_sales (
	Brand Varchar(30)
	Shop Varchar(30)
	Year Int
)
```
So, if a smartphone was sold, then we are going to enter the brand of the sold smartphone, in which shop the customer bought the smartphone and in which year happened the purchase. Of course, it would be more useful to enter instead of a year the exact date, but to understand the **aggregation operators** it is simpler to assume year instead of date.

Now, we would like to discover:
1. total amount of purchases per brand and year
2. total amount of purchases per brand
3. total amount of all purchases

To obtain these results we can use three regarding output equivalent SQL queries.

We could use the `group by` and `union all` to obtain all three requests:
```sql
-- first request:
(select Brand, Year, count(*) as Sales
from smartphone_sales
group by Brand, Year)
union all 
-- second request:
(select Brand, Null, count(*) as Sales
from smartphone_sales
group by Brand)
union all 
-- third request:
(select Null, Null, count(*) as Sales
from smartphone_sales);
```
However, it can be quite tedious to write every time all possible aggregations instead we can use `grouping sets`:

```sql
select Brand, Year, count(*) as Sales
from smartphone_sales
group by grouping sets ((Brand, Year), (Brand), ());
```
So, the `grouping sets` causes that SQL iterates the `group by` over $((Brand, Year),~(Brand),~())$. 

The tuple $((Brand, Year),~(Brand),~())$ obtains a sequence that goes from very specific overview $(Brand,~Year)$ to the global overview $()$, i.e. $()$ stands for the overall amount of purchases. This type of transition from specific to global is called **roll-up**, and the opposite is called **drill-down**.

The `grouping sets` is quite useful; however, it can be still tedious in case of a very specific overview with the goal to perform roll-up. Imagine determining all combinations for `grouping sets` to perform roll-up for $(Brand,~Shop,~Year)$. For this reason, SQL introduces the operation `rollup`:
```sql
select Brand, Year, count(*) as Sales
from smartphone_sales
group by rollup (Brand, Year);
```

Great! We now know how to solve the above requests. But, we are still curious and would like to discover:
1. total amount of purchases per brand, shop
2. total amount of purchases per brand, shop
2. total amount of purchases per shop

To solve these requests we can use `cube` operation:
```sql
select Brand, Shop, count(*) as Sales
from smartphone_sales
group by cube (Brand, Year);
```
